Welcome to gufiwrappers documentation!
========================================
Currently this tool is restricted to be used on Casper only. 
In order to use this tool do the following:

#. ssh to **casper.ucar.edu** (or execdav from cheyenne login nodes)
#. load gufiwrappers module *module load gufiwrappers*
#. run :doc:`gcache </gcache>` (with appropriate options)
#. optionally run :doc:`grprt </grprt>` (to generate brief reports)
#. optionally run gplot (work in progress) to produce graphical reports

The :doc:`gcache </gcache>` spawns GUFI query to **squall1** and stores 
the output into <gufi_tmp> tree. The :doc:`grprt </grprt>` reads the
raw report generated by :doc:`gcache </gcache>` and generates more useful
statitics. The gplot will generate graphical representation of some
of these statistics. So, the tool set is designed to be run in sequence:

#. :doc:`gcache </gcache>`
#. :doc:`grprt </grprt>`
#. gplot

# gufiwrappers

**gufiwrappers** is a collection of python scripts for NCAR users
of our Grand Unified File Index (GUFI) deployment for querying
and reporting against out data holdings under different 
NCAR storage devices maintained by CISL. The syntax of Raw **GUFI** 
query tools are somewhat terse and output most often 
requires further processing for meaningful and actionable reports. 
We target this tool will for this specific need.

The **GUFI** tools (primarily gufi_query or multi-threaded breadth
first search under a directory tree) generates raw reports, in csv
format, one file per thread. Considering the format and mechanism of
generation of this input the **gufiwrappers** toolset is broken 
into two parts,

#. **gwrap** (generates raw reports and optionally a file list))
#. **grprt** (generates statistics from raw report)

So functionally users need to execute these two commands in 
sequence.

To further augment the tool a plotting wrapper **gplot** has been
added to plot the histogram output generated by **grprt**. The
usage description of these tools with few examples are described
under [https://ncar.github.com/gufiwrappers]
